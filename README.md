# Support_Vector_Regression
> Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for regression tasks. Unlike traditional regression models that aim to minimize the error, SVR seeks to find a function that predicts within a certain margin of tolerance.

> SVR introduces a margin of tolerance (𝜖) within which predictions are considered acceptable. Data points lying outside the 𝜖-margin are called support vectors, as they determine the regression line.

## Advantages of SVR
+ Effective with High Dimensions:
Handles high-dimensional data efficiently, especially with kernel tricks.

+ Robust to Outliers:
Focuses on data within the 𝜖-margin, ignoring small deviations.

+ Non-Linear Relationships:
Models complex, non-linear relationships through kernels.
